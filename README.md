## **Project Goal & Objective**  
**GOAL:**  
To develop a predictive model that accurately diagnoses diabetes using medical diagnostic data from the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. The model will help identify individuals at risk based on key health indicators, enabling early detection and intervention.  
** OBJECTIVE:**  
This project aims to preprocess and analyze the dataset, identify significant predictors, and implement machine learning algorithms for diabetes prediction. The model's performance will be evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC. Additionally, feature importance analysis will provide insights into key risk factors, supporting better decision-making in healthcare.
